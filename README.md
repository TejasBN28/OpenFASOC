# OpenFASOC
Fully Open-Source Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits
The FASoC Program is focused on developing a complete system-on-chip (SoC) synthesis tool from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools.

# Installation
## 1. OpenFASOC:
The command used to install OpenFASOC are 
```
git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc

cd openfasoc

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the complete steps of installing OpenFASOC, refer Manual Installation from [here](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/getting-started.rst). 

## 2. OpenROAD: 
OpenROAD is an integrated chip physical design tool that takes a design from synthesized Verilog to routed layout. OpenROAD uses the OpenDB database and OpenSTA for static timing analysis. Documentation is also available [here](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main/README.html).


The commands to install OpenROAD are,
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git

cd OpenROAD

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh -run

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh -dev

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

```

## 3. Klayout
Downlaod the latest version of the Klayout from [here](https://www.klayout.de/build.html). Install the following dependencies: qt5-default, qttools5-dev, libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev, qtmultimedia5-dev, libqt5multimediawidgets5 and libqt5svg5-dev.
```
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5widgets5

sudo dpkg -i klayout_0.27.11-1_amd64.deb

```

## 4. Netgen
To install Netgen, 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ngsolve/ngsolve

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ngsolve

```

## 5. Yosys
The software used to run gate level synthesis is Yosys. Yosys is a framework for Verilog RTL synthesis. It currently has extensive Verilog-2005 support and provides a basic set of synthesis algorithms for various application domains. Yosys can be adapted to perform any synthesis job by combining the existing passes (algorithms) using synthesis scripts and adding additional passes as needed by extending the Yosys C++ code base.


To install yosys, install the prerequisites using the following command 
 ```
 sudo apt-get install build-essential clang bison flex \
	libreadline-dev gawk tcl-dev libffi-dev git \
	graphviz xdot pkg-config python3 libboost-system-dev \
	libboost-python-dev libboost-filesystem-dev zlib1g-dev
```
To install latest Version of Yosys, 
```
git clone https://github.com/YosysHQ/yosys.git

make

sudo make install 

make test

```

## 6. Magic

#### Prerequisites for magic
```
sudo apt-get install m4
sudo apt-get install tcsh
sudo apt-get install csh
sudo apt-get install libx11-dev
sudo apt-get install tcl-dev tk-dev
