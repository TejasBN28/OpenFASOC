# OpenFASOC
Fully Open-Source Autonomous SoC Synthesis using Customizable Cell-Based Synthesizable Analog Circuits
The FASoC Program is focused on developing a complete system-on-chip (SoC) synthesis tool from user specification to GDSII with fully open-sourced tools.

# Installation
## 1. OpenFASOC:
The command used to install OpenFASOC are 
```
git clone https://github.com/idea-fasoc/openfasoc

cd openfasoc

pip install -r requirements.txt
```
For the complete steps of installing OpenFASOC, refer Manual Installation from [here](https://github.com/idea-fasoc/OpenFASOC/blob/main/docs/source/getting-started.rst). 

## 2. OpenROAD: 
OpenROAD is an integrated chip physical design tool that takes a design from synthesized Verilog to routed layout. OpenROAD uses the OpenDB database and OpenSTA for static timing analysis. Documentation is also available [here](https://openroad.readthedocs.io/en/latest/main/README.html).


The commands to install OpenROAD are,
```
git clone --recursive https://github.com/The-OpenROAD-Project/OpenROAD.git

cd OpenROAD

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh -run

./etc/DependencyInstaller.sh -dev

mkdir build

cd build

cmake ..

make

```

## 3. Klayout
Downlaod the latest version of the Klayout from [here](https://www.klayout.de/build.html). Install the following dependencies: qt5-default, qttools5-dev, libqt5xmlpatterns5-dev, qtmultimedia5-dev, libqt5multimediawidgets5 and libqt5svg5-dev.
```
sudo apt-get install -y libqt5widgets5

sudo dpkg -i klayout_0.27.11-1_amd64.deb

```

## 4. Netgen
To install Netgen, 
```
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:ngsolve/ngsolve

sudo apt-get update

sudo apt-get install ngsolve

```
